# Restaurant Website 

## Overview

This repository contains the design and implementation of a restaurant website created as part of the [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page). The purpose of this project was to learn and practice the fundamentals of front-end web development, particularly the dynamic generation of content using **Webpack** and **JavaScript**.
The website layout adjusts across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
